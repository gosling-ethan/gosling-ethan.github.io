        <h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>This job helped shape me toward the career I wanted, I loved helping the students I worked with. This job was challenging and eye opening to be able to put my skills to test and help me become more adaptable to the needs of individuals and not a single solution answer. </p>

          <h2>Hillsboro R-3 School District / Technology Specialist<br/>

</h2>
 <p>To maintain, integrate, and survey technology equipment for the district. Train staff on safe technology practices.  Integrate new software by holding professional development for all staff members. Develop plans to help handle technology needs in the time of crisis.</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>This job has been the best in my life, I have been able to be a part of a great organization that has allowed me to build my skills in all areas. Transitioning from a Paraprofessional has helped me realize that when I am training staff I need to be prepared for a strategy that might not work with everyone and that I need to be adaptable to the situation. I have been able to hone my skills working in this position and the longer I am in it the better off I am and the people  that I teach.  One of the major accomplishments I was a part of, was to decide what to use for our Apple management system and how I could better our current system. I was tasked with researching different options and finding solutions that would fit our mold. </p>
