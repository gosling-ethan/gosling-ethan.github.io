        <h2>THE ADVENTURE</h2>
   <p class="first">As technology specialist at Hillsboro R-3 School District. My job is to support the technology throughout the entire District. I worked as a Paraprofessional before this job and I realized the impact I could make in students’ lives and wanted to transition to something that better suited my skill set and still made a difference in their lives. I love working with technology and can't wait for what is to come. Being a Technology Specialist has been a roller coaster of learning experiences and I have been prepared.</p>
        <h2>THE TOOLS I GAINED</h2>
    <p class="indent">I started getting more responsibilities in my role as a Technology Specialist the longer I worked at Hillsboro. Gaining skills to manage thousands of devices from my computer to being able to run training sessions with teachers and staff. Also, Keeping up with the latest and greatest tech is vital to making sure our school stays ahead of the curve and being as proactive as we can be than reactive. I gained some crucial project management skills at Mizzou taking a class that helped me better plan projects that I’ve been tasked with delivering. Gaining skills from my grad program has been a huge bonus to what I’ve been exposed to and I continue to develop more tools the more I keep at it.</p>
        <h2>THE PATH I KEEP WALKING DOWN</h2>
    <p class="indent">I want to always have the best insight I can possibly have into the world of education and a clearer understanding of the needs of educators. I take professional developmental things as often as I can. This mindset has helped me do a better job at taking my knowledge to the next level.  I plan on expanding my training as technology keeps evolving so I will be able to deliver what my District needs and help steer everyone into the future.</p>
