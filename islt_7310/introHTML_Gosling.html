My name is Ethan Gosling, I am a technology Specialist forHillsboro R-3 school district and I am in my last semester at Mizzou. I do have previous web training but I am looking forward to brushing up my skills and knowledge with this course. I have had prior experience with Dreamweaver and feel comfortable with it but I havenâ€™t really ventured outside of that much. I expect to learn more about web development in this course to help me learn how to better work outside of Dreamweaver. I hope to be able to use the skills I gain here to take back to work with me and develop a website that my department and I can use to better help our district. My favorite hobby is Rugby. I enjoy staying as active as I can. I am stuck at home here recently with the quarantine but I look forward to seeing what this course has in store for me!
