   <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Ethan Gosling. I have worked as a Technology Specialist for Hillsboro R-3 School District for the past 5 years and I also coach Cross Country and Track. Coaching people and working with technology quickly became my passion. Getting experience to interact with the students and educators by realizing the impact I could make in their life was invigorating. Technology is ever changing and I am motivated to keep up with the fast-pace. My goal is to become a leader and motivator for everyone I can.
